## §0 · About this document

### Purpose
One document, six concerns — kept strictly separated:

| Section | Concern | What lives here | What does NOT |
|---|---|---|---|
| §1 | Architecture & ground rules | Module glossary, sheets contract, invariants | Roadmap, designs |
| §2 | History | What's been shipped, with commit/PR refs | Speculation about future |
| §3 | Active subsystems | Reference docs for live features | Tactical to-dos |
| §4 | Roadmap | Phased plan with commit-level granularity | Implementation detail |
| §5 | Detailed designs | Per-feature data models, state machines, UI specs | Status tracking |
| §6 | Cross-cutting concerns | Patterns reused across features | Feature-specific design |
| §7 | Decision log | Chronological "we decided X because Y" | Open questions |
| §8 | Open questions | Per phase, what we still need to decide | Closed decisions |

When in doubt about *where* something belongs, ask: is this a status (§2), a reference (§3), a future plan (§4), a design (§5), a pattern (§6), a decision (§7), or a question (§8)?

### Audience
- Owner / business sponsor (priority calls, vision validation)
- Cursor IDE sessions (implementation reference, no need to re-explore the codebase)
- Future contributors (onboarding without re-asking decisions)

### Status legend
- ✅ **Done** — shipped, in production
- 🚧 **In Progress** — actively being built
- 📋 **Planned** — designed, queued for build
- 💭 **Discuss** — needs owner input before scoping
- ⏸ **Deferred** — acknowledged, not scheduled yet
- 🗄 **Archived** — superseded or no longer relevant

### 1.2 Sheets contract & discipline

**Hard rules:**
- Sheet schema is sacred — do not rename columns or sheets.
- Adding columns / sheets is OK only via `schemaMapper.js` so existing deployments auto-migrate on boot.
- Every repository module is the sole owner of its sheet — no direct `sheetsClient` calls from controllers.

**Sheets and their owners:**

| Sheet | Owner module | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Users, Departments | `usersRepository`, `departmentsRepository` | Org membership + management tree |
| Customers | `customersRepository` | Customer records, balances, credit |
| Inventory, Transactions, Returns | `inventoryRepository` etc. | Stock + sales |
| Tasks, **Incentives**, **TaskEvents** | `tasksRepository`, `incentivesRepository`, `taskEventsRepository` | Task workflow (see §3.1, §3.2) |
| ApprovalQueue | `approvalQueueRepository` | Multi-stage approvals |
| Settings, BotAuditLog, WebhookErrors | various | Bot internals |
| **TaskTemplates** (planned) | `taskTemplatesRepository` | Reusable task definitions (§5.2) |
| **UserPreferences** (planned) | `userPrefsRepository` | Adaptive UI state (§5.3) |
| **ForexRates** | `forexRatesRepository` | Manual FX rates entered by admin/finance (TG-INT 1.4 — see §2.9) |
| **ShipmentEvents** | `shipmentEventsRepository` | Carrier status updates per tracking number (TG-INT 1.3) |
| **BankFeed** | `bankFeedRepository` | Raw bank-feed transactions + reconciliation status (TG-INT 1.2) |
| **WhatsAppTemplates**, **WhatsAppOutbound** | (admin-maintained) + `whatsappOutboundRepository` | Wave-A WhatsApp send catalogue + audit (TG-INT 1.1) |

### 1.3 Approval semantics (sacred)

- Employee → admin gates and admin → 2nd-admin gates defined in `src/risk/evaluate.js` are NOT changed by feature work.
- Adding new actions requires adding them to `ACTION_POLICY` in `risk/evaluate.js`. The smoke harness fails if any action in the intent-parser enum lacks a policy entry.
- Climbing approvals (described in §3.3) extend, never replace, the existing 2-admin gates.

### 1.4 Privacy & money separation

- **Tasks sheet** has NO money columns. Admin / scrum-master views read only from here.
- **Incentives sheet** holds amounts; gated by `config.access.financeIds`.
- **TaskEvents.meta_json** may contain amounts; only finance-tier reports read this field.
- Customer-side credit/balance details are gated by the customer role itself + finance role.

### 1.5 Coding conventions

- One concern per file. Keep files <600 LOC where possible. `taskFlow.js` is approaching the limit and should split when it crosses 2000 LOC (target: `taskFlow/assign.js`, `taskFlow/negotiate.js`, `taskFlow/views.js`).
- Pure engines (state machines, graph helpers) are Telegram-free and unit-testable offline.
- Every state change in the task domain goes through the state machine — never call `tasksRepository.updateFields` directly for status changes.
- Append-only audit (`TaskEvents`) is the source of truth for performance analysis.

### 2.5b Manager visibility + admin observability (2026-05-14)

| Commit | Hash | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | `f947c60` | Manager controls — priority-sorted doer view + Re-prioritize + Drop-off | ✅ Done |
| T2 | `91b04bc` | Admin opt-in Activity Feed — per-user notification preferences | ✅ Done |
| T3 | `2455331` | Admin Sales Workflow view — read-only order/customer/ledger lens | ✅ Done |

**What this set delivers:**
- **T1**: `My Tasks` re-sorted by priority → soonest deadline → phase. New `🔝 Re-prioritize` and `🚫 Drop` buttons on every Team Tasks row (manager-only). State-machine additions: `update_priority` (self-transition, any open state) and `drop` (terminal → `dropped`, illegal from `submitted`). Smart doer DMs (silent for normal/low priority, audible for high/critical).
- **T2**: Centralizes broadcast notifications behind `src/services/adminFeed.js`. New `Users.notification_prefs` column (JSON) stores per-admin opt-in/out per event type. Admin hub gets a `⚙️ Notifications` screen for toggling. Defaults preserve today's all-on behavior — admins opt OUT at their pace. Catalog: `task.assigned/completed/dropped/declined/priority`, `order.created/accepted/delivered`, `payout.paid`.
- **T3**: New `📊 Sales Workflow` activity in Admin hub. Read-only grouped view of orders (pending / accepted / recently delivered), joined with customer phone, tier, credit limit, and current ledger balance. Tap-through detail card shows the customer's 3 most recent other orders for pattern-spotting. No new schema — Orders + Customers + LedgerBalanceCache already exist.

Admin override actions (force-accept, reassign, cancel) deliberately deferred — they need an Order state machine first.

### 2.5c Inbound supply loop · P1-P4 (2026-05-14)

| Commit | Hash | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `e954dba` | Inventory composite-key foundation (bale_uid + addedAt + grn_id) | ✅ Done |
| P2 | `b192808` | Goods Receipt Note (GRN) flow — inbound bale intake | ✅ Done |
| P3 | `94ba68e` | Quick Add Customer — admin one-line fast path | ✅ Done |
| P4 | `4ebde00` | Procurement Plan — low-stock alerts + PO drafting + GRN linkage | ✅ Done |

**Why this set:** the system could already *sell* and *transfer* goods,
but had no clean path to *receive* them from a supplier — "add stock"
was a CSV import. P1-P4 closes the inbound loop so every bale entering
a warehouse goes through a single, audited flow.

**What this set delivers:**
- **P1**: `Inventory` gains three columns — `bale_uid` (server-generated
  internal id `BAL-YYYYMMDD-{pkg}-{rand4}`), `addedAt` (ISO timestamp at
  row creation), `grn_id` (FK to `GoodsReceipts`). The printed-on-bale
  `PackageNo` stays as the human identifier and is now allowed to repeat
  across intake dates. `findByPackage(p, { latestOnly })` returns
  newest-first; `findByBaleUid()` resolves the unambiguous internal id.
  Legacy rows get synthetic `BAL-LEGACY-<rowIndex>` lazily on read;
  `backfillLegacyBales()` persists them in one batch when the operator
  is ready.
- **P2**: New `📥 Receive Goods` activity in the Stock hub. Compact 6-step
  flow (warehouse → supplier → design → shade → bales → confirm) with a
  bale-list parser accepting CSV (`5801,5802`), range (`5801-5810`), or
  mixed inputs. Each submit creates a `GoodsReceipts` header, appends
  bales via P1's `appendBale()`, and drops `Stock_Ledger` 'received'
  rows. Admins execute directly; employees route through admin approval.
  Inline ➕ New warehouse triggers a `add_warehouse` action which is in
  `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS` — meaning even an admin requester must get a
  *different* admin to approve (dual-admin gate via the existing
  `requireApproval` exclude-requester pattern). `rename_warehouse` uses
  the same gate.
- **P3**: Admins now see a `⚡ Quick Add` button on the Add Customer
  entry. One-line input (`Name, +234..., Lagos`) writes directly via
  `crmService.addCustomer` with sensible defaults (category=Standard,
  credit=₦0, terms=COD). Non-admin path unchanged. Parser is in a
  reusable util so future flows (and the smoke harness) can share it.
- **P4**: New `📋 Procurement Plan` view in the Admin hub. Surfaces
  low-stock alerts (distinct design/shade with available bales below
  `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD` setting — tunable via `/setlowstock N`) and
  open POs. `➕ New Procurement Order` walks through a multi-line PO
  draft (supplier → loop[design → shade → qty] → expected date →
  confirm). Open POs gain a `📥 Receive (PO-x)` button that launches the
  P2 GRN flow with the PO pinned in session; the service handler then
  applies received qty against PO lines and auto-advances the PO status
  (`draft → sent → partially_received → received`). Status transitions
  emit through `adminFeed` (`po.created` / `po.received` default ON,
  `po.partial` default OFF).

**New admin-feed events** (services/adminFeed.js inventory group):
`goods.received`, `warehouse.added`, `warehouse.renamed`, `po.created`,
`po.received`, `po.partial`.

**Smoke coverage:** S10 (P1, 6 checks), S11 (P2, 10 checks), S12 (P3,
8 checks), S13 (P4, 7 checks). Total +31 checks; harness at 119 green.

**Deferred to P5 (OCR add-on):** supplier-invoice photo → auto-fill of
design/shade/bale-list during step 5 of the GRN flow; business-card
photo → auto-fill of Quick Add. Provider-agnostic abstraction stubbed
out so OCR provider choice (Google Vision / Tesseract / OpenAI Vision)
is a one-file change when the operator decides.

### 2.5d Bulk Receive Goods · P2.5 (2026-05-14)

| Commit | Hash | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `cacf8cd` | CSV/XLSX parsers + bulk row validator (pure utils) | ✅ Done |
| C2 | `8547dc4` | `GoodsReceipts.source` + `file_hash` columns for idempotency | ✅ Done |
| C3 | `ec54406` | Bulk Receive flow + dual-admin risk + service handler | ✅ Done |
| C4 | (pushed) | Controller wire-up + Abdul-friendly CSV template doc | ✅ Done |
| C5 | (this set) | **Schema correction: `ThanNo` is now a required CSV column.** 1 row = 1 *than* (not 1 *bale*). Adds optional `NetMtrs` / `NetWeight`, file-level (PackageNo, ThanNo) uniqueness, per-bale design/shade uniformity, PO linkage counts distinct bales rather than thans. Sample CSVs ship at `docs/samples/`. | ✅ Done |

**Why this set:** the interactive 6-step GRN flow (P2) is great for two
or three bales, but when Abdul has a stack of 50 packaging slips after
a delivery, tapping through 6 steps × 50 bales is unworkable. Bulk
Receive lets him assemble the data offline in Excel/Sheets, upload one
file, and have admin sign-off applied to the whole batch in one stroke.

**Locked design (user decisions, 2026-05-14, refined in C5):**
- **1 row = 1 than.** A bale (`PackageNo`) contains 1..N thans (rolls).
  Each row is one than and writes one Inventory row. A bale with 5 thans
  is 5 rows sharing the same `PackageNo` with `ThanNo` running 1..5.
- **Append-only.** Every row becomes a *new* Inventory row with fresh
  `bale_uid` + `addedAt`. Existing rows are never mutated, reordered, or
  deleted. Repeated `PackageNo` is allowed both within a file (multiple
  thans of one bale) and across history (composite-key model from P1).
- **Per-bale uniformity.** All thans of the same `PackageNo` must share
  the same `Design` and `Shade` — enforced by the validator with a
  clear error message naming both rows.
- **(PackageNo, ThanNo) unique within a file.** You can't have two
  ThanNo=1 entries for the same bale in the same upload.
- **CSV + XLSX** in v1. CSV is the canonical format; XLSX is wrapped via
  SheetJS (`xlsx` npm package).
- **Reject the whole file** on any error (missing required column, bad
  warehouse, non-numeric yards). Abdul fixes everything in one pass.
  Single-warehouse + single-supplier per upload — multi-warehouse files
  surface a "split into one file per warehouse" message.
- **PO linkage is optional.** Entry step lets the operator pin an open
  PO; the service handler then routes received qty into
  `procurementOrdersRepo.applyReceived` and `recomputeStatus` advances
  the PO automatically.
- **Local archive** at `data/uploads/{fileHash}.{csv,xlsx}`. Cheap, fast,
  easy to inspect. Moves to Drive in a future release if cloud-audit
  becomes a requirement.
- **Dual-admin gate.** `bulk_receive_goods` is in
  `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS`, so even an admin requester needs a *second*
  admin's approval. Existing `requireApproval` excludes the requester
  from the approver pool.
- **Idempotency.** SHA-256 first-16-hex of the file's raw bytes lives in
  `GoodsReceipts.file_hash`. The flow rejects duplicates pre-archive and
  the service handler re-checks at persist time (race-condition guard
  if two admins approve simultaneously). Same file = same hash =
  rejected with `"Already imported as GRN-…"`.

**What this set delivers:**
- New `📤 Bulk Receive (CSV/XLSX)` activity in the Stock hub. Visible to
  anyone with `receive_goods` permission; routes through dual-admin
  approval regardless.
- `/bulkformat` slash command returns a copy-pasteable CSV template.
- Flow: 1) PO link (optional) → 2) file upload → 3) preview card with
  totals + hash → 4) Submit → 5) approval queue → 6) one GRN written
  with `source='bulk_csv'|'bulk_xlsx'` + `file_hash`, then N Inventory
  rows appended.
- New `GoodsReceipts` columns: `source` (column M), `file_hash` (column
  N). Lazy migration extends existing deployments; legacy 12-col rows
  parse cleanly with `source='manual'`.
- Validator caps file at 500 rows / 5 MB / 32-char PackageNo. Tunable
  via `Settings.BULK_IMPORT_MAX_ROWS` (future — defaults are fine for
  Abdul's expected volumes).

**Smoke coverage (S14):**
- **S14a — parsers/validator** (20 checks): CSV happy path, quoted
  cells, BOM, CRLF, escaped quotes, validator header/row/maxRows
  checks, multi-bale composite-key allowance, fileHash stability, XLSX
  round-trip, **(PackageNo, ThanNo) uniqueness (S14a.17)**, **per-bale
  design/shade uniformity (S14a.18)**, **ThanNo integer bounds 1–999
  (S14a.19)**, **NetMtrs/NetWeight optional + ≥0 numeric (S14a.20)**.
- **S14b — idempotency** (5 checks): 14-col GoodsReceipts parse with
  source + file_hash, legacy 12-col defaults to source='manual',
  getByFileHash hit/miss, append column count.
- **S14c — flow + service** (9 checks): risk policy returns
  approval_required for admins and employees, activity registered in
  stock hub, parseBuffer routes correctly by extension, error formatter
  truncates after 15 rows, **append-only contract + ThanNo persistence**
  (asserts 0 mutating writes to Inventory and verifies `ThanNo` lands in
  column F per row), idempotency race-condition guard at persist time.

Total +34 checks; harness at 153 green.

**Smoke contract that locks the spec:** S14c.8 instruments
`sheetsClient.updateRange` and `sheetsClient.batchUpdateRanges` and
asserts neither is called on `Inventory` after a bulk receive — only
`appendRows`. That's the machine-enforced version of "address / path /
detail of existing rows shall not be disturbed."

### 2.7 Photo Receive · P5 (in flight, 2026-05-14)

**Vision:** Abdul photos a packaging slip on his phone, the bot OCRs it,
shows the admin a per-row review card, admin approves each row (or
edits it), then the same dual-admin `bulk_receive_goods` approval gate
runs — so OCR is *capture-only*. The persistence path is identical to
P2.5 bulk CSV; only the row-capture mechanism changes.

**Locked decisions (user sign-off, 2026-05-14):**
- **Stub-first.** P5-C1 ships a deterministic stub provider so the UX
  can be built and smoke-tested offline. Real OpenAI Vision wiring
  lands in a follow-up commit once the per-row review UX is approved.
- **Inbound first.** P5a + P5b only. Outbound photo-dispatch (P5c)
  ships after a week of live inbound usage validates OCR accuracy on
  real slips.
- **Local + Google Drive backup.** Every uploaded image / PDF lands in
  `data/ocr/{hash}.{ext}` AND a `Bot Uploads / OCR / {YYYY-MM}/` Drive
  folder under the operator's account. Drive folder ID configurable
  via `OCR_GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`.
- **Per-row admin approval.** Every extracted row gets ✅ / ✏ / ❌
  buttons. Low-confidence rows (< `OCR_LOW_CONF`, default 0.7) render
  red and force ✏ before they can be accepted. AI never auto-commits.
- **No advanced features in v1.** A2–A8 (autocomplete, PO cross-ref,
  photo annotation, signature capture, invoice PDF, etc.) all deferred
  to P5e. Ship core P5 only.
- **No daily cost cap.** Skipped — operator monitors cost dashboard
  manually once real OCR is wired.

| Commit | Hash | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `5ae3a82` | Vision client interface + stub provider + config block | ✅ Done |
| C2 | `2fa1f6b` | Drive backup helper + local image archiving | ✅ Done |
| C3 | `dd769cc` | `photoReceiveFlow.js` — upload + per-row review UI | ✅ Done |
| C4 | `35ba5ac` | Per-row edit subflow + submission bridge into `bulk_receive_goods` | ✅ Done |
| C5 | (this set) | Operator docs + journal entry + .env example + ROADMAP polish | ✅ Done |

**P5 status: feature-complete behind the stub provider.** Real Vision
API wiring is a single follow-up commit (`OCR_PROVIDER=openai` plus
`OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`).

**P5-C1 ships:**
- `src/services/vision/index.js` — provider-agnostic dispatcher.
  Uniform return shape (`{ ok, provider, bales[], rawText,
  overallConfidence, warnings }`) regardless of which provider runs.
  Centralised input gating: empty buffer → `empty_buffer`, unsupported
  MIME → `unsupported_mime`, file > 5 MB → `file_too_large`, OCR
  disabled → `ocr_disabled`, provider throw → `provider_error`. Every
  failure mode surfaces as a structured `{ ok: false, error: '<code>:
  <message>' }` rather than an exception.
- `src/services/vision/stub.js` — deterministic 5-than single-bale
  fixture (matches `docs/samples/bulk-receive-sample-single-bale.csv`)
  with one intentionally-low-confidence row at ThanNo=3 so the
  review UI's red-row / force-edit path is always exercised. Supports
  override via `OCR_STUB_FIXTURE_PATH` for QA pinning of edge cases.
- `src/services/vision/openai.js` — skeleton returning `not_implemented`.
  Resolves so `OCR_PROVIDER=openai` gives a clear error instead of
  silently routing somewhere unexpected.
- `src/config/index.js` — new `ocr` block: `enabled` (flag),
  `provider` (stub|openai|google), `openaiModel`,
  `lowConfidenceThreshold`, `maxFileBytes`, `localArchiveDir`.
- Per-row `lowConfidence` flag computed during normalisation so flows
  don't have to repeat the threshold check.

**P5-C2 ships:**
- `src/services/vision/driveBackup.js` — top-level `archiveImage(buf,
  mime)` writes a SHA-256-named copy to `data/ocr/{hash}.{ext}` and
  (if `OCR_GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID` is set) uploads to a `{YYYY-MM}` subfolder
  under that ID. Local archive is idempotent — same bytes → same path
  → no rewrite, so re-uploaded slips don't duplicate on disk.
- Drive backup is *best-effort*: API failures don't break the local
  archive, the error is surfaced in `result.driveError` instead. The
  bot never loses an operator's image to a quota or network blip.
- Drive auth uses the existing Sheets service-account credentials with
  the `drive.file` scope added. That scope is locked to files the
  service account itself creates, so it cannot read the operator's
  wider Drive.
- Helpers exported for direct use by flows / tests:
  `sha256First16`, `extensionFor`, `monthLabel`, `archiveLocally`,
  `ensureMonthFolder`, `uploadToDrive`, `_setDriveClient` (test escape
  hatch).
- `.gitignore` extended to cover `data/uploads/` (P2.5) and `data/ocr/`
  (P5) so the archives never accidentally end up in source control.

**P5-C3 ships:**
- `src/flows/photoReceiveFlow.js` — full Telegram flow with five steps
  (PO link → file upload → OCR + per-row review → submit → approval).
  Reuses the bulk receive shape; only the capture and review steps are
  new.
- Per-row review card:
  - One line per OCR row showing status icon, `PackageNo-T<ThanNo>`,
    design / shade / yards / confidence%, with `🔴` for low-confidence
    rows.
  - Three buttons per pending row (`✅ N`, `✏ N`, `❌ N`) — but
    **low-confidence rows hide the ✅ button entirely**, so the operator
    can't accept them without engaging with the data.
  - "Decided X/N · Pending P · Low-conf open L" live progress tracker.
  - Decided rows render with `↩ Undo N` so admin can change their mind.
  - Mass action `✅ Accept all OK rows` — flips every *pending,
    non-low-conf* row to accepted in one tap. Already-decided and
    low-conf rows are left alone.
  - Submit button is auto-disabled until pending=0 AND accepted≥1; the
    button text live-updates (`▶ Submit (decide 3 more)`).
- Controller wired up:
  - `act:photo_receive_goods` callback opens the flow (new entry in
    `activityRegistry` under the Stock hub with `📷` icon).
  - `pr:*` callback namespace dispatched to `photoReceiveFlow.handleCallback`.
  - `handleFile()` consumes both `msg.photo` (compressed via Telegram)
    and `msg.document` (full-quality images + PDFs) during an active
    `photo_receive_flow` session in `await_file`.
- Low-confidence interaction lock baked in: `acceptAllOk()` skips
  low-conf rows; per-row `✅` button hidden for low-conf pending rows.
  No way to silently let low-confidence data through.
- `risk/evaluate.js` now exports `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS` (was already
  internal) — smoke can verify the bridge target. `photo_receive_goods`
  itself is intentionally **not** a write action: the actual write
  always happens via `bulk_receive_goods`, which is in
  `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS`. The photo flow is purely a capture layer.
- C4 hooks reserved: the `pr:row_edit:<n>` and `pr:submit` callbacks
  currently show a "coming in P5-C4 (next commit)" message so the UX
  doesn't dead-end, and the controller wiring is already in place — C4
  just fills in the handlers.

**P5-C4 ships:**
- *Per-row edit subflow* — tap `✏ N` opens a field-by-field edit panel:
  `PackageNo`, `ThanNo`, `Design`, `Shade`, `Yards`, `NetMtrs`,
  `NetWeight`. Each field button starts a text-input prompt; admin
  sends the new value, validator coerces it, panel re-renders. Admin
  can edit any number of fields then `✅ Save row`. `↩ Discard edits +
  back` reverts via a snapshot taken on edit-entry so changes are atomic.
  Editing a low-confidence row automatically clears its `🔴` flag — by
  touching the cell, the admin has explicitly vetted it.
- *Field-type coercion* — string fields enforce length limits matching
  the bulk validator (PackageNo ≤ 32, others ≤ 80). Integer fields
  (ThanNo) range-checked 1–999. Positive-number fields (Yards) must be
  > 0. Non-negative-number fields (NetMtrs, NetWeight) must be ≥ 0.
  Sentinel `-` clears optional fields (`Shade`, `NetMtrs`, `NetWeight`)
  so admin can undo OCR-introduced garbage without inventing a delete
  UI. Required fields refuse to clear.
- *Real submit bridge* — `pr:submit` no longer dead-ends. Accepted +
  edited rows go through the existing `bulkRowValidator.validate` (so
  file-level invariants from P2.5-C5 still apply: single warehouse,
  (PackageNo, ThanNo) unique, per-bale design/shade uniformity), then
  build an `actionJSON` with `action: 'bulk_receive_goods'` and
  `source: 'ocr_vision_<provider>'`. The payload includes the OCR raw
  text (capped at 2000 chars), per-row edit audit (`editedRows`), and
  the image's SHA-256 hash so the existing idempotency guard in
  `inventoryService.executeApprovedAction` picks it up the same way it
  does for bulk CSV.
- *Same approval gate as CSV* — `riskEvaluate.evaluate({ action:
  'bulk_receive_goods' })` returns `approval_required` regardless of
  who submits; `approvalQueueRepository.append` queues the request;
  `approvalEvents.notifyAdminsApprovalRequest` notifies admins with the
  requester excluded if they're an admin themselves. Approval card
  summary now includes `· N edited` when the admin tweaked OCR output.
- *Controller wire-up* — `handleMessage` routes text messages to
  `photoReceiveFlow.handleText` when an active `photo_receive_flow`
  session exists. Routing is namespace-isolated (no collision with
  any other text-step flow).

### 2.8 Phase 4 · Scalability (legacy TG-22 .. TG-26)

All 💭 Discuss — never start without an explicit owner decision (see §4.6).

### 2.13 PRICE-VIS-C1 · Phase 1 foundation for layered price visibility (2026-05-30)

Surfaces two existing prices in the bot, both gated behind a single
new helper module so we can widen visibility per department later
without churning every callsite. No new sheets, no new columns, no
new price-entry flows.

* **Two prices, one identity each — both already admin-set with 2-admin
  approval today**
  * **Sale price** = `Inventory.PricePerYard` (set via `update_price`).
    The real selling price for that design+shade. Phase 1: admin only.
    Shown in **Check Stock** as `Sale: ₦X/yd` per design+shade plus the
    existing `Value:` totals.
  * **Base price = landed cost** = `GoodsReceipts.lc_ngn_per_yard` (set
    via `finalize_landed_cost`). The owner's "base price" — what the
    design cost us. Phase 1: admin only. Shown in **Inventory Details →
    Design Wise** as `Base: ₦X/yd` on each design header.

* **Foundation: one tiny service, two predicates** —
  `src/services/pricingService.js` exports
  * `canSeeSalePrice(userId)` → Phase 1: `auth.isAdmin`. Phase 2 will
    widen via `Departments.permissions` (`see_sale_price` capability),
    granted/revoked from Department Management with 2nd-admin approval.
  * `canSeeBasePrice(userId)` → Phase 1+: `auth.isAdmin`. Stays
    restrictive (your buying cost).
  * Plus pure helpers `resolveSalePrice(rows, design, shade?)` (latest
    non-zero PricePerYard + mixed flag) and `resolveBasePriceByDesign
    (items, grns)` (per-design `lc_ngn_per_yard` from the latest
    finalized GRN, joined by `grn_id`). Both helpers are pure / sync /
    smoke-testable.

* **Display changes** (Phase 1 = admin-only everywhere)
  * `sendCheckStockReport` — appends `· Sale: ₦X/yd` per shade row;
    `Value:` total gated.
  * `queryEngine.stockSummary` — appends `Sale: ₦X/yd` per design+shade
    line; per-line and total `— ₦value` tails gated.
  * Free-text intent handlers — `Value:` in `check_stock` and
    `Price: …/yard` in `package_detail` now gated.
  * `buildInventoryDesignReport` — appends `· Base: ₦X/yd` (or
    `· Base: pending` when the GRN hasn't been finalized yet) to each
    design header. `pending` doubles as a signal to finalize that
    landed cost.

* **Behavior change worth noting** — a handful of money lines were
  ungated before (Check Stock `Value:`, package detail `Price:/yard`,
  free-text stock-summary value). Phase 1 tightens these to admin-only,
  matching the owner rule "right now only admin can see the price".
  Phase 2 reopens them to chosen departments.

* **Sample-photo guardrail on `update_price`** (non-blocking)
  * On design pick the existing `maybeSendDesignPreview` sends the
    DesignAssets card (the 9006-style shade card). Its return value
    now stamps `session.sampleOnFile`.
  * Shade picker prepends `⚠️ No sample photo on file for <design> —
    upload via Design Photos. You can still proceed.` when missing.
  * Confirm card adds two context lines so the admin knows exactly
    what's being priced: `📷 Sample: ✓ on file` (or ⚠️ none) and
    `📅 Stock received: <Month Year>` from the latest matching
    inventory `dateReceived`. The 2-admin `update_price` approval
    itself is unchanged.

Files touched: `src/services/pricingService.js` (new),
`src/services/queryEngine.js`, `src/controllers/telegramController.js`
(`sendCheckStockReport`, free-text `check_stock`/`package_detail`,
`buildInventoryDesignReport`, `upd:` callback, `showUpdatePriceShadePicker`,
`showUpdatePriceConfirm`).

Smoke coverage: `scripts/smoke.js` adds **S30** (11 checks) — gate
return values, `resolveSalePrice` latest-non-zero + mixed handling,
`resolveBasePriceByDesign` latest-finalized + pending case + empty
inputs, `stockSummary` admin/non-admin/anon paths.

Phase 2 (deferred) — extend the two predicates to honor a
`Departments.permissions` CSV column (`see_sale_price`, `see_base_price`),
granted/revoked from Department Management. **No display changes
needed** because the gate is already centralized.

Phase 3 (deferred, "last in queue") — `RegionSurcharges` sheet to layer
logistics + operational surcharges on top of the base price so each
region (Lagos, Kano, …) sees its effective price. Mirrors the existing
landed-cost allocation pattern; still zero Inventory schema changes.

### 2.12 BS-C1 · Kano poly-colour bundle sale (design-first picker) (2026-05-23)

Dedicated sale flow for warehouses that hold poly-colour bales (the
Kano model: one bale = 150 yd = 6 shades × 25 yd). Lagos mono-colour
bales keep using the existing `sale_bundle` path; this flow opens a
parallel door for the cases where the current "pick a bale" UI maps
poorly onto a customer conversation that runs "shade-first, then which
bale".

**Owner brief (2026-05-22, full conversation):**

> "In kano they prefer to take all the colours in one bale with combined
> all colour present in the catelogue of the particular design having
> 150yards (6 colour of 25 yards each bundle [than])."
> "Please let me know how my office manager in kano can mark the
> bundle (than) sold in interactive way with more tappable infographic
> option rather than more manual entry."
> "Add one more option to sell in thans/bundles. Show them the total
> thans/bundle against the colour within the design selected. Once
> sales boy taps the colour/shade he will be seen total yards and with
> bundle present with different bale number. User can tap on the all
> or some from one bale than next bale in sequence."

**UX — "design-first, colour-aggregate, bale-by-bale bundle picker":**

```
1. Warehouse  (auto-skipped if user has 1 home warehouse)
2. Design     (chips, sorted by available yards desc)
3. Shade      (per-shade aggregate: yards · than count · bale count;
               🎯 Pack target yardage escape hatch lives here)
4. Bales      (per-bale picker for the chosen shade, oldest-first
               with 🟢/⚪/🟠/🔴 age chips, "📦 Take all N remaining"
               shortcut, sticky cart counter)
5. Cart       (collapsible by shade: summary by default; expand →
               per-bale than breakdown; per-line/per-bale remove)
6. Customer   (recent buyers of this design as quick chips,
               + 🔎 search, + ➕ Walk-in)
7. Rate       (typed, with last-to-this-customer / last-any /
               30d-median / floor (landed cost) suggestions as
               one-tap chips; "below floor" confirm gate when entered
               rate < floorRate)
8. Payment    (Cash / Bank Transfer / Pending)
9. Confirm    (LIVE re-check vs Inventory; conflicts auto-drop with
               actionable list; total = yards × rate)
10. Submitted (existing sale_bundle approval pipeline)
```

**Schema additions:**

- `Shades` sheet (8 cols, seeded with 10 canonical entries — Red/Green/Blue/Yellow/Purple/Orange/White/Black/Brown/Pink). Admin-editable name → display emoji → supplier_colour_no → aliases. Falls back to a generic 🎨 chip when a name has no entry — picker never breaks on a new shade.
- `Inventory.bin_location` (col U, lazy-migrated). Optional shelf/bin reference rendered next to bale headers in the bundle picker. Empty for warehouses that don't track shelves.

**Receive-side fork (`goodsReceiptFlow.js`):**

After picking design, the flow asks "Bale type": Mono-colour (Lagos —
unchanged) or Multi-colour (Kano — 6 shades × 25 yd). The poly path:

1. Multi-select shades from the design's existing palette + ➕ new shade.
2. Pick yards-per-than (chips: 20 / 25 / 30 / 40 / 50 / ✏️ custom).
3. Bale numbers (CSV or range — same parser as mono).
4. Expand: each physical bale × each picked shade → 1 Inventory row
   (thanNo = 1..N). 5 bales × 6 shades × 25 yd = 30 thans / 750 yd.
5. Confirm preview rolls up by packageNo: `Bale 6101 → Red (25y),
   Green (25y), Blue (25y), Yellow (25y), Purple (25y), Orange (25y) = 150 yd`.

`inventoryService.executeApprovedAction` for `receive_goods` now reads
`b.shade || aj.shade` and `b.binLocation || aj.binLocation || ''` — the
per-bale override falls back to the existing top-level value, so the
mono-colour code path is byte-identical to today's behaviour.

**Smart-Pack assist:**

"🎯 Pack target yardage" prompts the manager to type a target (e.g.
`75`). The bot flattens all available thans for the design (across
all shades), sorts oldest-first (FIFO), and greedily takes thans until
the cumulative yardage meets the target. Returns three numbers:
`pickedYards`, `shortBy` (when stock is insufficient), `overshoot`
(when whole-than rounding lands above the target). Manager sees a
shade-grouped preview and a single tap commits the whole basket to
the cart. No backtracking on rounding overshoot — textile customers
generally accept "a few extra" over "a few short", and the manual
picker is one tap away if a finer dial is needed.

**Conflict re-check (no row locks):**

Optimistic concurrency. The cart holds rowIndex+baleUid+thanNo for
each line. On entering the Confirm step AND again on Submit,
`bundleSaleService.reconcileWithLive` re-reads the live Inventory and
compares every cart line. Anything sold/transferred since cart-build
is dropped with an actionable reason (`sold`, `not_found`, etc.) and
the manager sees a refresh banner. Avoids reservation timeouts and
"why is my row locked" support tickets.

**Rate suggestion (`rateSuggestionService.js`):**

Reads `Transactions` for design-matching approved sales and joins on
`Inventory.grn_id → GoodsReceipts.lc_ngn_per_yard` for the floor:

| Suggestion | Source |
|---|---|
| Last to this customer | most recent sale_bundle row matching design+customer |
| Last (any customer) | most recent sale_bundle row matching design |
| 30-day median | median of last-30-day `pricePerYard` for design |
| Floor (landed cost) | max `lc_ngn_per_yard` across available bales' GRNs |

When the typed rate falls below the floor, the flow opens a "Below
cost-recovery floor" confirm card before advancing to payment. Owner
can override (sale-at-loss is sometimes deliberate), but the gesture
is explicit.

**Approval payload (reuses existing pipeline):**

```json
{
  "action": "sale_bundle",
  "items": [
    { "type": "than", "packageNo": "6101", "thanNo": 1, "baleUid": "BAL-K-001", "yards": 25, "design": "KAFTAN", "shade": "Red" },
    ...
  ],
  "customer": "Alhaji Bello",
  "salesDate": "2026-05-23",
  "paymentMode": "Cash",
  "pricePerYard": 4500,
  "bundleFlow": "BUNDLE-SALE-C1",
  "enrichment": { "ratePerUnitByDesign": { "KAFTAN": 4500 }, "paymentMode": "Cash", "amountPaid": ... }
}
```

`inventoryService.executeApprovedAction(sale_bundle)` already handles
this exact shape (markThanSold loop → ledger DR → transactions row).
Zero changes to `approvalEvents`, `inventoryService`, or any approval
UI. The new flow ships entirely behind a new entry door + 4 new files.

**Files:**

- `src/repositories/shadesRepository.js` (sole owner of the new sheet; `getAll`, `getActive`, `resolve`, `resolveFrom`, `chipFor`, `chipFromList`, 60 s TTL cache, alias matching, case-insensitive)
- `src/repositories/inventoryRepository.js` (added `bin_location` to header / parseRow / toRow / read range `A2:U` / +`groupByBaleAndShade` 2-level aggregator with FIFO bale sorting + per-shade summary + age stamping)
- `src/services/bundleSaleService.js` (cart model + `addLines`/`removeLines`/`removeBale`/`clearCart`/`totals`/`summarise` + `smartPackForTarget` (greedy FIFO) + `reconcileWithLive` + `buildApprovalPayload` + `submitForApproval` + `ageBucket` helper)
- `src/services/rateSuggestionService.js` (`suggestFor` (last-to-customer / last-any / 30d-median / floor), `formatSuggestionLines`, `recentSalesForDesign`, `computeFloorRate`, `median`)
- `src/flows/bundleSaleFlow.js` (10-step anchored card flow; `bs:*` callback namespace; smart-pack sub-flow; collapsible cart; below-floor confirm gate; auto-skip warehouse picker when single warehouse)
- `src/flows/goodsReceiptFlow.js` (added `bale_type` step + `showMultiShadesStep` + `showMultiYardsStep` + multi-colour text/callback handlers + back-routing for new steps + multi-bale confirm rendering)
- `src/services/schemaMapper.js` (declared `Shades` sheet with 10-row seed; extended Inventory lazy migration `INV_NEW_COLS` to include `bin_location`)
- `src/services/inventoryService.js` (`receive_goods` now reads `b.shade`/`b.binLocation` per-bale with fallback to `aj.shade`/`aj.binLocation`)
- `src/services/activityRegistry.js` (new `bundle_sale` entry in `stock` hub; 🧵 icon)
- `src/controllers/telegramController.js` (act-dispatcher `case 'bundle_sale'`; `bs:*` callback router; text-input router)

**Decisions (owner brief, all approved as defaults on 2026-05-22):**

| Q | Decision |
|---|---|
| Entry door            | Single `bundle_sale` in Stock hub (icon 🧵). Discoverable by everyone with Stock hub access — the role gate is the existing `sale_bundle` approval, not the flow door. |
| Mono vs poly fork (sell side) | Always offer the new flow; the picker simply renders 1-shade aggregate when a design only has 1 shade. Zero forks at the user level — the same UX works for Lagos. |
| Mono vs poly fork (receive side) | Explicit "Bale type" step after design. Lagos managers tap "Mono" once; their flow is unchanged from there. |
| Smart-Pack rounding | Whole-than overshoot (e.g. target 70 yd → 75 yd basket). Manager can always trim manually. No fractional-than UX. |
| Conflict handling   | Optimistic, no row reservations. Re-check on Confirm + on Submit. Drop unavailable lines with `dropped[].reason` and show a refresh banner. |
| Below-floor sale    | Confirm gate, not block. Selling at a loss is sometimes deliberate (closeout, distress). |
| Cart UI             | Collapsible by shade. Default = 1 line per shade. Tap shade → expand → per-bale than chips. |
| Customer picker     | Recent buyers of THIS design at top, + 🔎 search, + ➕ Walk-in. Same pattern as supply-request flow. |
| Shades catalogue    | Own sheet (`Shades`), seeded with 10 canonical entries. Admin can append/edit without code change. Fallback emoji (🎨) for unknown names — picker never breaks. |
| Bin / shelf reference | Optional. New `bin_location` column on Inventory, empty for warehouses that don't track shelves. Rendered next to bale headers when present. |
| Rate suggestion sources | Transactions (most-recent / 30d-median, per design ± per customer) + GoodsReceipts (lc_ngn_per_yard for floor). No new sheets. |

**Smoke (`S29`, 23 checks):** schema declared with all 8 Shades cols +
bin_location in INV_NEW_COLS + canonical seed rows verified +
activityRegistry surfaces `bundle_sale` in stock hub + controller

**Smoke total:** 399 ok / 0 failed (was 370).

**Substrate unlocked for:**

- §1.5 demand-driven pricing engine — same `groupByBaleAndShade` aggregator powers per-warehouse demand visibility (Kano demand pulls bales from HQ).
- §1.7 customer-facing wholesale negotiation — same cart + conflict-recheck pattern; just swap the customer-picker for the customer-self picker.
- §1.10 OCR receipt → cart pre-fill — Smart-Pack target yardage step is the natural landing zone for "OCR says they want 75 yd"; one-tap apply.

**Follow-ups (deliberately not in this commit):**

- Demand-driven pricing engine (§1.5) — separate commit; will reuse `rateSuggestionService.suggestFor` and add a `demandIndex` term per warehouse.
- Customer-history pre-select chips on the shade picker ("you usually buy 4 Red + 2 Green" — pre-tick from prior cart).
- Photo of a basket (cart) on submission — useful for cross-region distribution disputes.
- A per-shade demand counter / re-order suggestion fed back to the procurement hub when a shade dips below a configurable floor.

### 2.11 BR-OPS C1 · Branch managers' daily routine + Office expenses (2026-05-22)

Quantum-style daily workflow for the two branch managers (Abdul / Lagos,
Muhammad / Kano). Captures the morning operational state of each
branch and itemises office expenses with single-admin sign-off. Heavy
reuse — most of the morning routine is shortcuts to flows that already
exist (samples, receipts, customers, marketers); only the daily-open
log + the expense batch are genuinely new.

**Sheet discipline (owner-asked constraint — "without compromising
scalability"):** ONE new umbrella sheet `BranchOpsLog`, polymorphic
via a `kind` discriminator. Adding a new daily-routine item later =
new `kind` value, no new sheet, no new repo, no new migration. Per-bale
inventory math and finance ledger stay in their existing sheets — this
one only holds the operational timeline (and pointers into those sheets).

**Decisions (owner brief, all approved as defaults on 2026-05-22):**

| Q | Decision |
|---|---|
| Branch resolution     | Read `user.warehouses[0]` (existing column). Manager never picks. Falls back to `manages` then `'HQ'`. |
| Cash currency         | NGN. (USD landed-cost lives in §2.10.) |
| Camera check          | Single yes/no for V1 (per-camera list deferred until a camera roster exists). |
| Expense approval      | Single-admin (you) via `WRITE_ACTIONS`. Flip to dual-admin when finance joins by moving `record_office_expense` to `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS` — one-line edit, no schema or flow change. |
| Recurring titles      | Top-8 from THIS manager's last 30 days. 80% of typing disappears after a week of use. |
| Day-close             | Deferred to V2 — open + expenses + reused flows ship now; closing-cash + day-summary card lands once daily routine is in steady use. |
| "Yesterday outstanding" | Read-only summary on step 3 of the open card + 2 deep-link buttons. Doesn't bloat the daily routine. |
| Auto-open on first morning interaction | No — tap-only. Daily card opens via the menu, not after attendance mark. |
| Discovery placement   | New top-level **Daily** hub holding the 2 entries. Cleaner than nesting under Tasks. |
| Reused flows          | They keep their existing entry doors AND show up as shortcuts inside the Daily status panel — same code, two doors. |

**Sheet:**

`BranchOpsLog` (single umbrella, append-only; status flips happen on
the existing row, not by writing a new row):

```
op_id | date | branch | manager_id | manager_name
kind        — daily_open | camera_check | opening_cash | expense
            | sample_issued | receipt_logged | customer_registered
            | marketer_registered | day_close (V2)
subject     — free-text title or human label
amount      — NGN when relevant, else blank
ref_id      — sample_id / receipt_id / customer name / marketer_id when
              this row is a pointer into another sheet
photo_url   — Drive URL when relevant
status      — logged | pending_approval | approved | rejected
approval_request_id
notes
created_at | updated_at
```

**Files:**

- `src/repositories/branchOpsLogRepository.js` (sole owner of the new sheet: `append`, `appendMany`, `findByBranchDate`, `findByApprovalRequestId`, `isDayOpen`, `getRecentExpenseTitles`, `updateStatusByApprovalRequestId`)
- `src/services/branchOpsService.js` (`resolveBranch`, `openDay` (idempotent), `submitExpenseBatch`, `applyExpenseBatch`, `cancelExpenseBatch`, `logPointer`, `getDailySummary`, `validateExpenseItems`, `todayInTz`)
- `src/flows/dailyBranchOpsFlow.js` (manager-facing — 3-step open card → collapses to a status panel with shortcuts; idempotent re-tap)
- `src/flows/officeExpenseFlow.js` (batch entry — 2-field form per item, quick-pick from manager's last-30d top-8 titles, undo last, submit)
- `src/risk/evaluate.js` (`record_office_expense` appended to `WRITE_ACTIONS`; display name added)
- `src/services/activityRegistry.js` (new `daily` hub; 2 codes `daily_branch_ops` + `office_expense`)
- `src/services/inventoryService.js` (post-approval branch for `record_office_expense`; reject-path cleanup; pointer hooks inside `add_customer` / `give_sample` / `register_marketer` post-approval branches)
- `src/controllers/telegramController.js` (act-dispatcher cases + `bops:*` + `ofex:*` callback routers + text-input routers + pointer hook after `receiptsRepo.append`)

**Discovery / per-user gating:**

`daily_branch_ops` and `office_expense` follow the standard
`Departments.allowed_activities` CSV gate — add the two codes to
Abdul's department and Muhammad's department. No controller injection,
no env var, no special-case visibility logic. A 3rd manager joining
next quarter = one CSV cell edit.

**Approval policy:**

| Action | Bucket | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `record_office_expense` | `WRITE_ACTIONS` (single-admin) | Owner: "Goes to admin approval (me for now)". |
| `daily_open` (camera + cash) | None | Operational log, not state-changing. |
| `give_sample` / `upload_receipt` / `add_customer` / `register_marketer` | Existing policies — unchanged | We only add pointer rows; the underlying actions are untouched. |

**Pointer rule (key to keeping the sheet count down):**

Detailed sample / receipt / customer / marketer rows STILL live in
their own sheets. `BranchOpsLog` only stores pointer rows
(`kind=sample_issued, ref_id=<sample_id>`) so the manager's "Today"
panel + the weekly finance read both query ONE sheet. Pointer writes
are fire-and-forget — failures swallow into a warn log so a roll-up
blip never fails the underlying business action.

**Smoke (`S28`, 16 checks):** schema declared with all 15 cols +
policy in `WRITE_ACTIONS` (and explicitly NOT in `ALWAYS_APPROVAL`) +
activityRegistry entries in `daily` hub + `resolveBranch` reads
`warehouses[0]` + `openDay` writes 3 rows + `openDay` idempotent on
re-tap + `validateExpenseItems` trims + rounds + fail-fast errors +
`submitExpenseBatch` queues 1 approval + writes 3 eager pending rows +
`applyExpenseBatch` flips to approved + `cancelExpenseBatch` flips to
rejected + `logPointer` writes auto-resolved branch+manager +
`getDailySummary` rolls everything up + negative-cash refuses +
`getRecentExpenseTitles` dedups case-insensitively.

**Smoke total:** 370 ok / 0 failed (was 354).

**Substrate unlocked for:**

- §1.4 financial reporting — weekly finance roll-up reads `kind=expense, status=approved` from `BranchOpsLog` per branch, no new joins.
- §1.10 task management — branch-scoped task lens can use `branch` + `manager_id` as filter dimensions.
- BR-OPS C1.5 (V2 day-close): same flow, adds `day_close` kind + closing-cash field. ~150 LOC follow-up.

**Follow-ups (deliberately not in this commit):**

- Day-close flow (closing cash + day summary card; auto-roll opening
  cash forward to next morning).
- Per-camera check once cameras are inventoried in a sheet.
- Manager-scoped variant of the attendance report restricted by `branch`.
- Promote `record_office_expense` to dual-admin when finance joins (single-line edit in `risk/evaluate.js`).

### 2.10 LANDED-COST C1 · USD landed cost + import charges (2026-05-21)

Admin-driven feature for sealing the true cost of received goods.
Closes the gap between "what did we pay the supplier" (USD) and "what
does each yard ACTUALLY cost us in NGN" (after container clearance,
clearing agent, logistics, demurrage, insurance, customs, bank
transfer fees).

**Decisions (owner brief, all approved):**

| Q | Decision |
|---|---|
| Allocation rule | **Per yard** — every charge divided by `total_yards` across the GRN |
| Charge types | **Editable catalogue sheet** (`LandedCostTypes`, seeded with 7 common types) — admin can add more over time without code change |
| Entry timing | **After receipt** — separate "Finalize Landed Cost" flow, GRNs land as `provisional` first |
| FX locking | **At finalize time** — rate pulled from the manual `ForexRates` provider (TG-INT 1.4) and sealed on the GRN row |
| Inventory schema | **Unchanged** — landed cost lives on the GRN row; per-bale lookup is a 1-hop join via existing `grn_id` column |
| Container model | **1 GRN = 1 container** for V1 — multi-container split deferred |
| Approval gate | **Dual-admin** (`finalize_landed_cost` ∈ `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS`) — wrong numbers cascade into every margin report |

**Schema:**

- New sheet `LandedCostTypes` — `type_id | type_name | active | created_at | created_by | notes`. Seeded with: Container Clearance, Clearing Agent, Logistics, Demurrage, Insurance, Customs Duty, Bank Transfer Fee.
- New sheet `ContainerCharges` — `charge_id | grn_id | type_id | type_name | amount_usd | entered_by | entered_at | notes`. Append-only audit trail; one row per charge entered.
- `GoodsReceipts` extended with 8 columns (lazy migration in schemaMapper for existing deployments): `lc_status` (`provisional` | `pending_approval` | `finalized`), `lc_usd_per_yard`, `lc_charges_usd`, `lc_fx_rate`, `lc_ngn_per_yard`, `lc_finalized_at`, `lc_finalized_by`, `lc_request_id`.

**Files:**

- `src/repositories/landedCostTypesRepository.js` (catalogue I/O)
- `src/repositories/containerChargesRepository.js` (append-only charges)
- `src/repositories/goodsReceiptsRepository.js` (extended: read 24 cols; `markPendingLandedCost` / `finalizeLandedCost` / `clearPendingLandedCost` mutators)
- `src/services/landedCostService.js` (pure allocation math + `submitForApproval` / `applyApproved` / `cancelPending` / `getForBale` / `listProvisional` / `resolveFxRate`)
- `src/flows/landedCostFlow.js` (admin-only multi-step UI: GRN picker → USD/yd → charges picker+amount → FX confirm → preview → submit)
- `src/risk/evaluate.js` (`finalize_landed_cost` appended to `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS`)
- `src/services/activityRegistry.js` (`💵 Finalize Landed Cost` in admin hub)
- `src/services/inventoryService.js` (post-approval branch in `executeApprovedAction` + rejection-cleanup in `rejectApproval`)
- `src/controllers/telegramController.js` (act dispatcher + `lcost:*` callbacks + text-input router)

**Formula:**

```
usd_charges_per_yard  = total_charges_usd / total_yards_in_grn
usd_landed_per_yard   = usd_cost_per_yard + usd_charges_per_yard
ngn_landed_per_yard   = usd_landed_per_yard * fx_rate_at_receipt
```

**Smoke (`S27`, 16 checks):** schema declared + GoodsReceipts cols
extended + policy in ALWAYS_APPROVAL + activityRegistry entry + math
correctness (positive path + zero-yard refuse + bad USD/FX fail-fast)
+ FX resolution (manual hit + missing surfaces actionable error) +
submit-flow queues request + flips GRN to `pending_approval` +
double-submit blocked + `applyApproved` seals row + persists charges
+ `cancelPending` reverts on reject + `getForBale` resolves cost via
`grn_id` back-pointer + `listProvisional` excludes finalized/pending.

**Smoke total:** 354 ok / 0 failed (was 338).

**Reads consumed by:** the upcoming margin reports (§4.4 financial
reporting) and the future wholesaler-floor-pricing logic (§1.2 of
`docs/vision-textile-trading.md`). Today's sales / supply flows are
unchanged — `PricePerYard` retains its current "selling price"
meaning; cost is a parallel data lane.

**Follow-ups (not in this commit):**

- Admin Forex Rates UI (button-only entry into `ForexRates` sheet) so
  admins don't have to type into the sheet. Tracked under TG-INT-A3.
- 3-day reminder for GRNs still provisional — needs the parked ATT-C3
  scheduler.
- Per-design USD-cost (instead of one-rate-per-GRN) — V2 only if
  practice demands it.
- Sales / margin reports surfacing `lc_ngn_per_yard` alongside
  `PricePerYard` — owned by FIN-C1..C6.

### 2.9 TG-INTEGRATIONS · Third-party adapter layer (2026-05-21)

Introduces `src/integrations/` — a top-level module that wraps every
external vendor behind a stable adapter interface so the business logic
never depends on a specific SDK. The whole point is that swapping a
provider (e.g. Twilio → Meta WhatsApp, Zenith → Mono) is a one-env-var
change, not a code rewrite.

**Shipped (Wave A — Commit 1):**

| # | Capability | Providers (env default → others)                                | Persistence sheet           | Notes |
|---|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| 1 | monitoring | `stub` → `glitchTip`, `sentry`                                  | (reuses `AuditLog`)         | `@sentry/node` loaded lazily; optional dep |
| 2 | forex      | **`manual` (default)** → `stub`, `exchangeRateApi`, `openExchangeRates` | `ForexRates`                | Per business decision: admin/finance enters rates manually; API providers are scaffolds only |
| 3 | shipment   | `stub` → `dhlExpress` (Maersk reserved)                          | `ShipmentEvents`            | Each tracked event persisted with `reference_id` for join-back |
| 4 | banking    | `stub` → `zenithBank`, `mono` (Setu reserved)                    | `BankFeed`                  | Reconciler in `src/services/bankReconciler.js`; match confirm is dual-admin gated |
| 5 | messaging  | `stub` → `metaWhatsApp`, `twilio`                                | `WhatsAppTemplates`, `WhatsAppOutbound` | Outbound only — inbound (Wave B) intentionally deferred (`messaging/INBOUND_DEFERRED.md`) |

**Architectural rules enforced by smoke (`S23` – `S26`, +8 / 9 / 1 / 4 checks):**

- `S23` — shared infra: `providerSelector` falls back to `stub`;
  `auditWrapper` records `{capability, provider, operation, success,
  durationMs}` to `AuditLog`, rethrows the original error, and
  swallows audit-write failures so a Sheets outage cannot take down
  the integration call it wraps.
- `S24` — every capability's public surface (`rate / track /
  fetchTransactions / send / captureException`) plus `getEstimatedCost`
  works against its stub provider.
- `S25` — vendor-SDK isolation: forbidden packages (`@sentry/node`,
  `twilio`, `@dhl/*`, `mono-node`, `@mono/*`) are not `require()`d
  anywhere outside `src/integrations/`. This is the regression
  tripwire — if a future maintainer reaches around the adapter layer,
  CI fails.
- `S26` — schema + policy wiring: all 5 new sheets are declared in
  `schemaMapper.js`; `set_forex_rate` + `notify_wholesaler` are in
  `WRITE_ACTIONS`; `confirm_bank_reconciliation` +
  `broadcast_wholesalers` are in `ALWAYS_APPROVAL_ACTIONS`;
  `config.integrations.forex.provider` defaults to `'manual'` and the
  other four default to `'stub'`.

**Smoke total:** 338 ok / 0 failed (was 310).

**Phase 2 placeholders (folders + README, no code):**
`integrations/banking/setu.js`, `integrations/shipment/maersk.js`,
`integrations/analytics/` (Looker Studio / Metabase), `integrations/storage/` (S3).

**Not in this commit (deferred bodies of work):**

- WhatsApp **inbound** — webhook signing, consent registry, routing
  to Telegram operators. See `messaging/INBOUND_DEFERRED.md`.
- Admin forex-rates flow (button-only entry into `ForexRates` sheet)
  — the adapter is ready; the UI lands in a follow-up.
- Wiring `monitoring.captureException` into `server.js`'s
  `unhandledRejection` / `uncaughtException` handlers — left as a
  follow-up so this commit is purely additive and reversible.
- Real banking endpoints for Zenith — provider file throws
  `BANKING_NOT_WIRED` until credentials are finalised, so an
  accidental env flip cannot silently return empty data.

## §3 · Active subsystems (reference)

### 3.1 Task state machine

**Engine:** `src/flows/taskStateMachine.js` — pure, offline-testable.
**UI:** `src/flows/taskFlow.js` — every status change routes through the engine.

```
┌────────┐  propose_timeline    ┌────────────────────────┐
│assigned│ ────────────────────▶│ awaiting_timeline_ack  │◀──┐
└───┬────┘                       └──┬──────────┬──────────┘   │

       (cancel allowed from every non-terminal)      (terminals)
```

**Invariants:**
- Every transition writes one row to TaskEvents (audit log).
- Negotiation rounds (counter + renegotiate) hard-capped at 3.
- Money never written to Tasks sheet — only to Incentives sheet.
- Self-transitions (`set_incentive`) are legal and don't change status.

### 3.2 Incentive system

**Storage:** `Incentives` sheet (separate from Tasks). 10 columns including `paid_status` lifecycle: `pending → awaiting_payout → paid` (or `cancelled`).

**Lifecycle:**
1. Assigner taps `Set incentive` during `awaiting_timeline_ack` → Incentives row created, `paid_status=pending`.
2. Assigner accepts timeline → status moves on; Incentives row untouched.
3. Doer final-acks → `doer_confirmed_at` stamped on Incentives row.
4. Assigner approves completion → `paid_status` flips to `awaiting_payout`.
5. Finance marks paid (manual today; UI in commit 4) → `paid_status=paid`, `paid_at`, `paid_amount`.

**Visibility:**
- Task assigner sees their own incentive set; can change while in `awaiting_timeline_ack`.
- Doer sees only their own incentive (on deal card + completion DM).
- Admin / scrum-master views NEVER show money.
- Finance role (`config.access.financeIds`) sees the Incentives sheet via the planned Incentives Report.

### 3.3 Organizational hierarchy & climbing approvals

**Model:** Tree rooted at Admin. Single parent per node. Customers are leaves attached to an owner.

**Encoded in:**
- `Departments.parent_department` (CSV-free; empty = top-level)
- `Users.manages` (CSV of departments this user heads)
- `Users.departments` (CSV of departments this user belongs to)

**Helpers** (`src/org/deptGraph.js`):
- `validateForest(depts)` → returns `{ graph, errors }` (rejects cycles)
- `listAssignableUsers(actor, allUsers, graph)` → who can `actor` assign tasks to
- `canSee(actor, target, resource)` → visibility check
- `lowestCommonAncestorDept(a, b)` → cross-branch routing

**Climbing approvals** (planned, not used by tasks today):
- Forward-up with required comment
- Grievance skips the subject node
- Cross-branch routes to LCA then down
- 24h auto-escalate for Critical (optional v1.1)

**Notification priorities:**

| Level | Push | Sound | Re-ping | Inbox |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | ✓ | ✓ | every 30 min | ✓ |
| High | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Normal | ✓ | silent | — | ✓ |
| Low | — | — | — | ✓ |

### 3.4 Audit log

`TaskEvents` sheet, append-only. Every task lifecycle event = one row.

Event types currently emitted:
- `assigned`, `doer_proposed_timeline`, `assigner_countered_timeline`, `doer_renegotiated`
- `assigner_set_incentive`, `assigner_accepted_timeline`, `doer_final_ack`
- `doer_marked_done`, `assigner_approved`, `assigner_rejected`
- `doer_declined`, `assigner_cancelled`
- `doer_marked_started_legacy` (back-compat fast-forward for pre-commit-3 tasks)

`meta_json` column stores event-specific payloads (e.g. `{hours, deadline}` for proposals; `{amount, currency}` for set_incentive). Admin Tasks views never read `meta_json`. Finance reports do.

### 3.5 Onboarding

Script: `scripts/onboard-employee.js` (npm alias `onboard`).

Idempotent operations:
- Create or update a Users row
- Ensure a Department exists (with merged `allowed_activities` if updating)
- Optionally set the user's role / access / branch
- `--force` to update existing rows

Used so far for: Abdul Ahmed (`7430648262`) → Sales department → `upload_design_photo`, `browse_catalog`, `search_design_photo`.

## §4 · Roadmap (forward-looking)

### 4.0 TG-INT Wave-A — Third-party adapter layer ✅ Done (2026-05-21)

Shipped as commit `TG-INT-A1`. Five capabilities live under
`src/integrations/` behind a stable adapter contract — see §2.9 for
the full table and `src/integrations/README.md` for the swap procedure.
Smoke `S23`–`S26` enforce the rules. Follow-ups (admin Forex Rates UI,
monitoring wiring in `server.js`, WhatsApp inbound, live banking
endpoints) tracked separately.

### 4.0a Vision — Textile Trading Bot 📘 (2026-05-21)

Owner brief captured in `docs/vision-textile-trading.md` — 11 work
clusters covering marketer flows, wholesaler-direct negotiation,
warehouse audit, financial reporting, HR/payroll, key management,
sample tracking, document repository, customer-data discipline, task
close-tracking, and data-hygiene migration. Document is the discussion
substrate, not a commitment list. Re-read before each planning session.

### 4.0b LANDED-COST C1 · USD cost + import charges + NGN landed cost ✅ Shipped (2026-05-21)

Owner approved all defaults: per-yard allocation, editable type
catalogue, after-receipt entry, FX locked at receipt, Inventory schema
untouched (lookup via existing `grn_id`), one GRN = one container,
dual-admin approval. See §2.10.

### 4.1 Commit 4 — Reports 📋 Planned (next)

**Deliverable:**
- **Performance Report** (admin / scrum-master): time-to-propose, time-to-accept, on-time rate per doer/dept. NO money.
- **Incentives Report** (finance only): grouped by `paid_status`; one-tap `✅ Mark paid` for `awaiting_payout` rows.
- **Audit Trail** (admin): per-task timeline view of TaskEvents.

Detailed design: §5.1

### 4.2 Commits 5a, 5b, 6 — Task Templates 📋 Planned

**5a** — `TaskTemplates` sheet + admin "Manage Templates" hub item.
**5b** — "From template" path in Assign Task (skip steps; one-tap deal locking).
**6** — Manager-proposed templates + bot self-learning suggestions (5+ identical in 30 days).

Detailed design: §5.2

### 4.3 Commit 7 — Adaptive UI 📋 Planned

`UserPreferences` sheet drives picker reordering, sensible defaults, "Repeat last" shortcuts.

Detailed design: §5.3

### 4.4 Commits 8–9 — Customer-side deals 💭 Discuss

Customer onboarding on Telegram; order placement with credit-limit auto-approval; ledger view. Reuses templated task infrastructure for fulfillment.

Detailed design: §5.4

### 4.5 Commit 10+ — Conversational AI front-door ⏸ Deferred

LLM-driven slot filling on top of the existing tap UI. Model tier decided at implementation time, not now.

Detailed design: §5.5

### 4.6 Commits 11–14 — Referral graph + Loyalty platform 💭 Discuss

Two-sided affiliate-and-customer-loyalty platform integrating the bot with `atfactoryprice.com`. Scenario C confirmed (workers refer workers, customers refer customers, separate rules per chain).

**Sub-commits:**
- **11** — Referral graph + identity reconciliation across bot and website
- **12** — `LoyaltyLedger` sheet + configurable earning rules
- **13** — Website ↔ bot identity and balance bridge
- **14** — Redemption flow (optional, creates fulfillment tasks via existing template runner)

**Pre-requisites that must happen BEFORE commit 11 starts:**
- Legal / accounting conversation about local rules for referral commissions (Nigeria — the line between legitimate referral and pyramid scheme depends on real product flow, which the business has, but the commission formula must be designed to stay clearly compliant)
- Identity-reconciliation review of `atfactoryprice.com`'s existing user model (email/phone/username) so the bridge in commit 13 is correct from day one
- Loyalty-point governance decisions: expiry policy, transferability, withdrawal-on-departure, accounting liability treatment

Detailed design: §5.6 (placeholder for now; full spec to be written when commits 8-9 are stable)

### 4.7 Admin direct task assignment ✏ ✅ Done

~~Small UI addition to bypass the org-tree filter when admin assigns.~~ During implementation it was discovered admin already bypasses the filter via `isAdmin: true` in `listAssignableUsers`. The release-night work was a **scope badge** instead: assignee picker now shows *"🛡 Admin mode — showing all N active employees"* for admins, *"👥 Manager mode — showing N from your reporting subtree"* otherwise. Shipped in commit `dbea342` alongside Mark Paid UI.

### 4.8 Commits PA-1 through PA-5 — Payment Automation 📋 Planned

**Full spec:** [`specs/payment-automation.md`](specs/payment-automation.md)

**Summary:** Five-commit track that closes the order-to-cash loop. Auto-DM customer after delivery with tier-aware payment details; OCR uploaded receipts to pre-fill admin review (Google Vision default, Tesseract fallback); integrate with Nigerian bank API (Mono default, Okra/Paystack/Flutterwave alternatives) to auto-match incoming transfers; surface the existing customer ledger as a friendly **Wallet** UI with top-up and apply-to-order; deliver premium-tier payment-request experiences for Gold and Platinum customers including a one-tap "Talk to John directly" button.

**Architectural shape:** new `paymentStateMachine.js` (9 states, mirrors task/order state-machine pattern). Reuses `erpEventBus` to listen for `order.delivered` events from Customer Orders. Wallet is a **friendly read** of the existing `LedgerTransactions` sheet — no duplicate ledger, no double-bookkeeping.

**Commit decomposition:**
- **PA-1** — PaymentRequests schema + auto-DM trigger (depends on Customer Orders being deliverable)
- **PA-2** — OCR layer (Google Vision + Tesseract fallback + Nigerian-pattern parser)
- **PA-3** — Bank API integration + matcher (depends on Nigerian fintech provider research)
- **PA-4** — Wallet UI + WalletTransactions schema (customer-facing balance + top-up + apply-to-order)
- **PA-5** — Premium tier templates + nightly tier engine

**Pre-requisites before PA-3 starts:** 2-3 hours of Nigerian fintech provider research (Mono vs Okra vs Paystack vs Flutterwave for bank coverage, pricing, SLA). Owner decision required.

**Key design decisions captured:**
- OCR is admin assistance, NOT proof of payment. Admin always taps approve. `AUTO_APPROVE_HIGH_CONFIDENCE` defaults to `false`.
- Bank statement remains the source of truth; weekly reconciliation report catches drift.
- Wallet reuses `LedgerTransactions` (extended), not a new sheet — one source of truth.
- Tier downgrades happen silently; only upgrades celebrated via DM.
- Each subsystem has its own feature flag for independent rollback.

### 4.9 Deferred items (legacy Phase 4)

| ID | Topic | When to revisit |
|---|---|---|
| TG-22 | `Store` interface + Redis backend | When we go multi-instance |
| TG-23 | Sheets → Firestore migration | When Sheets API quota hurts |
| TG-24 | Webhook queue (Cloud Tasks / BullMQ) | When error rate matters |
| TG-25 | Containerize + CI | Anytime; mechanical |
| TG-26 | ESLint + Prettier | Anytime; format on touch |

## §5 · Detailed designs

### 5.1 Reports (commit 4)

**Three surfaces:**

#### Performance Report (admin / scrum-master)
- **Audience:** managers + admin. NO money.
- **Inputs:** TaskEvents joined with Tasks. Compute on read (no precomputed aggregates yet).
- **Metrics per doer:**
  - Median time-to-propose (assigned → propose_timeline)
  - Median time-to-final-ack (accept_timeline → final_ack)
  - On-time completion rate (completed_at ≤ proposed_deadline)
  - Negotiation rounds avg
  - Rework rate (rejected % of submitted)
- **Filters:** date range, department, doer.
- **Surface:** Tasks hub → "📊 Performance".

#### Incentives Report (finance only)
- **Audience:** `config.access.financeIds`.
- **Inputs:** Incentives sheet.
- **Sections:** `awaiting_payout` (with Mark Paid button), `pending`, `paid` (recent), `cancelled`. Subtotals per section + grand totals.
- **Mark Paid flow:** tap → optional `paid_amount` override + notes → Incentives row updated → DM to doer optionally.
- **Surface:** new top-level activity "💰 Payouts" (visible only to finance).

#### Audit Trail (admin)
- Per-task: list every TaskEvents row chronologically. Used for disputes.
- Surface: "View audit" link inside Pending Sign-off cards.

**New files:**
- `src/flows/reportsFlow.js` (UI)
- `src/services/reportsService.js` (data aggregation)
- new admin/finance hub items

### 5.2 Task Templates (commits 5a, 5b, 6)

**Full spec:** [`specs/templates.md`](specs/templates.md)

**Summary:** new `TaskTemplates` sheet (20 cols), three growth paths (admin curated, manager proposed, bot self-learning at 5+ identical/30d), per-template `auto_negotiate` + `requires_doer_ack` knobs to control doer friction. Reuses existing task state machine — no engine changes beyond a 5-line carve-out for synthetic `system_template:*` actors.

**Commit decomposition:**
- **5a** — TaskTemplates schema + admin Manage Templates UI
- **5b** — "From template" picker + templateRunner.js (consumption side)
- **6** — Manager-proposed templates + bot self-suggestions + suppression state

Open questions (8) tracked in spec §8.

### 5.3 Adaptive UI (commit 7)

#### UserPreferences (or `Users.prefs_json` column — TBD at implementation)

```json
{
  "last_assignee_id": "7430648262",
  "last_hours": 4,
  "last_priority": "high",
  "last_track": "incentivized",
  "favorite_template_ids": ["TMPL-002", "TMPL-005"],
  "hours_pick_freq": {"4": 12, "2": 5, "8": 3},
  "priority_pick_freq": {"high": 10, "normal": 8},
  "track_pick_freq": {"salaried": 15, "incentivized": 7},
  "last_updated": "2026-05-11T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Where it surfaces

| Picker | Adaptive behavior |
|---|---|
| Hours | Top row = 4 most-used by frequency, descending |
| Priority | Most-used pre-selected with ✓ |
| Track | Most-used pre-selected |
| Assignee | "⭐ Last: Abdul" pinned first; then alphabetical |
| Templates | Favorited templates first |
| My Tasks home | "🔁 Repeat last: 'Wire panel' to Abdul (4h, ₦3k)" if assigner pattern detected within 7d |

**Gating:** no adaptation until ≥3 samples per dimension. Static defaults below that.
**Reset:** admin command `/reset_my_prefs` clears the row.

### 5.4 Customer-side deals (commits 8–9)

**Full spec:** [`specs/customer-orders.md`](specs/customer-orders.md)

**Summary:** customer becomes a third principal type (alongside admin and employee). Telegram-only for now; WhatsApp migration sketched in spec §11. Own state machine (`OrderStateMachine`) since order lifecycle differs from task negotiation. Auto-approval rules pipeline checks customer status, item validity, total caps, credit limit, deposit, and configurable business gates. Auto-approved orders **reuse the task state machine** for the fulfillment side via a templated "Dispatch order #X" task — this is the core architectural reuse from commits 5-6.

**Commit decomposition:**
- **8** — Onboarding + ledger + auto-approval rules engine + admin pending-orders queue
- **9** — Order placement UI (catalog browse + cart + submit) + fulfillment bridge

Spec is **TBR-heavy** (10 open questions, several depending on existing Customers/Sales/Catalog schema). Must read existing repo before commit 8 starts.

### 5.5 Conversational AI front-door (commit 10+)

**Status:** ⏸ Deferred. Design only.

#### Three phases inside this commit
1. **Slot filler** — extract `{assignee, title, priority, track, incentive, hours, deadline}` from free-form text. Confidence per field. Below-threshold field → drops to tap UI for that field only.
2. **Dialog manager** — bot asks clarifying questions and updates slots iteratively.
3. **Cross-actor coordination** — bot relays between assigner and doer with light paraphrasing.

#### Cost containment
- Cheap model (Haiku / GPT-4o-mini) for slot filling
- Mid model only for ambiguity resolution
- LRU cache for repeated phrases
- Hard per-user-per-day budget; falls back to tap UI when exhausted
- Structured outputs (JSON schema) to prevent hallucinations

#### Safety
- Every AI-driven task creation still routes through the state machine → unchanged validation, audit, approval semantics.
- "AI assisted" badge on tasks created via conversation, so audit can distinguish.

### 5.6 Referral graph + Loyalty platform (commits 11–14)

**Status:** 💭 Discuss. High-level shape only; full spec to be written under `specs/referral-loyalty.md` when commits 8-9 (Customer Orders) are stable.

#### Concept (Scenario C confirmed)
**Two separate referral chains** with separate earning rules:

| Chain | Who joins it | Who pays into it | What flows up |
|---|---|---|---|
| Worker chain | Workers / distributors recruited by other workers | Worker output (sales brought in, tasks completed, etc.) | Commission points to direct parent + diminishing share to grandparent and above |
| Customer chain | Customers recruited by other customers | Customer purchases | Loyalty points to direct referrer + smaller share to upline (if any) |

Both chains feed the same **LoyaltyLedger** but with different earning rules. Points are economically equivalent to money (redeemable on `atfactoryprice.com` for goods, software, hardware, discounts).

#### Architectural reuse
- **State machine pattern**: `LoyaltyEventEngine` reuses the same transition + audit shape as TaskStateMachine and OrderStateMachine.
- **Tree pattern**: `deptGraph.js` patterns generalize to referral-tree ancestor walks for multi-level distribution.
- **Privacy pattern**: distributors see their own balance and their downline's earnings, not anyone else's. Same gating model as `financeIds`.
- **Redemption-as-task pattern**: a customer redeeming N points for a computer creates a fulfillment task via the existing template runner (commits 5-6 reuse). Beautiful symmetry.

#### `atfactoryprice.com` integration (both surfaces)
- Storefront: customers browse, buy, see their loyalty balance
- Registration funnel: new distributors and customers sign up there with a referral code, get auto-linked to the parent in the bot's tree
- Identity reconciliation: shared user model across bot (Telegram ID) and website (email/phone) — one user, multiple channels, one balance

#### Non-negotiable design constraints
- Real product flow (fabric sales to real customers) must remain the primary value driver. Referral commissions are secondary. This keeps the structure clearly on the legitimate side of MLM regulations.
- Every loyalty point grant and redemption writes an append-only LoyaltyLedger row with actor, source event, amount, and resulting balance.
- Points are NOT money in any legal/accounting sense, but ARE liability on the books once granted. Accounting integration is required.

#### Open questions before any code
See §8.6.

## §6 · Cross-cutting concerns

### 6.1 Schema migrations
`schemaMapper.js` auto-creates missing sheets/columns at bot startup. Process:
1. Add the new sheet definition to `REQUIRED_SHEETS` (or new column to existing entry).
2. Deploy. Next boot adds the sheet/column with empty/default values.
3. No manual sheet ops; idempotent across redeploys.

### 6.2 Testing strategy
- **Offline smoke** (`npm run smoke`): pure-logic checks; no sheets/Telegram/OpenAI. Current: 76 checks across 8 sections (S1-S8). Add Sn-N checks for every new repository/engine module.
- **Manual smoke**: `TESTING.md` — checklist per business flow. Run before any UI-touching deploy.
- **Production observation**: `BotAuditLog` + `WebhookErrors` sheets (when implemented per TG-3 / TG-5).

### 6.3 Session management
`sessionStore` is the only source of truth for in-flow state. Session types in active use:
- `task_assign_flow` — assigner's 6-step picker
- `task_propose_flow` — doer's hours/deadline picker (incl. calendar)
- `task_counter_flow` — assigner's counter note input
- `task_incentive_flow` — assigner's amount input
- (planned) `task_template_flow`, `customer_order_flow`

Rule: every new multi-step flow gets its own session type. Never reuse types across domains.

### 6.4 Performance budget
- Sheets API: stay under 100 calls/minute. Caching (TG-11) when load demands it.
- OpenAI: only NL paths hit OpenAI. Cache (TG-16) when costs demand.
- Telegram edits in-place (anchor pattern) — avoid sending new messages where edit is possible.

### 6.5 Privacy & access control

| Data | Owner gates | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks | All employees (own + manageable subtree) | Money never shown |
| Incentives | `financeIds` only | Doer sees their own row's amount |
| TaskEvents.meta_json | `financeIds` (when amount inside) | Audit tab strips money for admin |
| Customers (credit/balance) | `financeIds` + the customer themselves | Sales team sees only contact info |
| Templates | All managers (consume); admin (create/approve) | n/a |
| User prefs | Each user (own only); admin (reset) | n/a |

## §7 · Decision log

Reverse chronological — newest first.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-12 (late) | Add commits PA-1..PA-5: Payment Automation track (auto-DM, OCR, bank API, wallet, premium tier templates) | Owner observed admin workload around payment receipt verification is high; OCR + bank API + tier-aware DM can take 80-95% of that off admin. Wallet is friendly skin over existing ledger. |
| 2026-05-12 (late) | OCR is admin assistance, never autonomous approval | Receipts are forgeable; bank statement is truth. `AUTO_APPROVE_HIGH_CONFIDENCE` defaults to false. Admin always taps. The tap takes 1 second — that 1 second is the fraud-resistance. |
| 2026-05-12 (late) | Both OCR and Bank API designed from day one | Owner explicit choice; provider-agnostic abstractions allow either to be enhanced/swapped without rewriting the matcher or the admin UI. |
| 2026-05-12 (late) | Wallet reuses LedgerTransactions, not a new sheet | One source of truth. "Wallet" is a customer-friendly read of the existing ledger; the new columns just add wallet-specific source_type and direction. |
| 2026-05-12 | Add commits 11–14 to the roadmap: Referral graph + Loyalty platform with `atfactoryprice.com` integration | Owner's business model requires a two-sided affiliate-and-customer-loyalty system. Architectural patterns from tasks/orders generalize cleanly. |
| 2026-05-12 | Scenario C confirmed: worker chain AND customer chain, separate rules, shared LoyaltyLedger | Most ambitious but most powerful. Workers earn from worker-output; customers earn from customer-purchases. |
| 2026-05-12 | `atfactoryprice.com` serves both as storefront and registration funnel | Single coherent surface across bot and web; loyalty balance and identity must be unified across channels. |
| 2026-05-12 | Admin direct task assignment shortcut folded into commit 4 (Reports) | Quick win (~1-2h); admin needs this to test the reporting surface freely without dancing through org-tree filters. |
| 2026-05-11 | Templates support per-template `auto_negotiate` + `requires_doer_ack` (rather than global) | Different routine tasks have different friction tolerances |
| 2026-05-11 | Bot self-learning trigger: 5+ identical in 30 days | Conservative; avoid suggesting templates from incidental repeats |
| 2026-05-11 | No monetary caps yet on auto-approvals; rely on admin FYI | Faster delivery; tighten if abuse emerges |
| 2026-05-11 | Customer surface stays Telegram for now; WhatsApp deferred | Don't multiply surfaces before proving the model |
| 2026-05-11 | Pick AI model at implementation time, not in design | Pricing/quality changes monthly |
| 2026-05-11 | Both bot-curated AND manager-proposed templates; bot self-suggests after threshold | Wide net for capturing routine work |
| 2026-05-10 | Reorder negotiated flow: incentive BEFORE accept_timeline | Assigner can think holistically about timeline + bonus together |
| 2026-05-10 | Accept button gated on incentivized track until incentive set | Prevents accidental "₦0 by default" outcomes |
| 2026-05-10 | Salaried track stays incentive-free (no optional bonus) | Keeps flows clean; avoid edge cases |
| 2026-05-10 | Calendar deadline picker: Mon-first 7-col grid, cap +6 months forward | Standard Telegram bot pattern; matches local UX |
| 2026-05-10 | Custom hours: numeric reply, decimals OK, max 720h | Cover edge cases without UI bloat |
| 2026-05-10 | Templates: pre-deploy legacy tasks preserved (no migration) | Cleanest cutover, no data risk |
| 2026-05-09 | Negotiation cap = 3 rounds (counter + renegotiate combined) | Prevents thrashing; forces decision |
| 2026-05-09 | Incentives sheet separate from Tasks sheet | Privacy: scrum-master admin must never see compensation |
| 2026-05-09 | TaskEvents append-only audit | Performance analysis + Gantt later |
| 2026-05-09 | Doer's final-ack required on salaried track too | Symmetric with incentivized; no silent fast-forward |
| 2026-05-09 | Finance role split from admin role (`financeIds`) | Privacy of compensation data |
| 2026-05-08 | Org hierarchy: tree (single parent), encoded in `parent_department` + `manages` | Minimal sheet footprint; deterministic resolution |
| 2026-05-08 | Climbing approvals: forward-up with required comment, grievance skips subject | Reflects real-world delegation |
| 2026-05-08 | Notification priorities: 4 levels with distinct push/sound/re-ping | Critical work cannot be missed; low-priority doesn't burn attention |

## §8 · Open questions

Per phase. Each must be answered before that phase starts.

### Commit 4 — Reports
- Q: Should the Performance Report include a Gantt chart view? (Telegram inline keyboards can't render bars natively — would need an HTML link to a hosted page.)
- Q: For Incentives Report — group by doer or by date? Or pick on render?
- Q: Should "Mark paid" send a DM to the doer ("✅ Your ₦5,000 was paid")?

### Commits 5a/5b — Templates core
- Q: Template editing — full UI in bot, or admin edits the sheet directly first version?
- Q: Should templates be department-scoped or globally available?
- Q: Per-doer rate limits inside templates (e.g. max 3 daily-sales-report tasks per doer per day)?

### Commit 6 — Manager-proposed + self-learning
- Q: Self-suggestion: should admin auto-approve manager-proposed templates after N successful uses? Or always manual approve first time?
- Q: "Don't ask again" — per template-title pair, or per manager globally?

### Commit 7 — Adaptive UI
- Q: Prefs storage: separate `UserPreferences` sheet or `Users.prefs_json` column?
- Q: Reset command — admin-only, or each user can reset their own?

### Commits 8–9 — Customer orders
- Q: Do customers go into the `Users` sheet with `role=customer`, or a separate `Customers` sheet? (Need to check what exists.)
- Q: Auto-approval credit check — does `credit_limit_remaining` mean (limit − outstanding_balance) or (limit − sum_of_pending_orders)?
- Q: Required deposit logic — fixed % per category? Per customer term?
- Q: How does the customer pay? Bank transfer with manual confirm, or integrate with a payment gateway later?

### Commit 10+ — Conversational AI
- Q: Whose conversations get AI parsing — only managers, or doers too?
- Q: When the AI is uncertain, drop to tap UI silently or explicitly ("I'm not sure about the deadline — please pick:")?
- Q: Budget cap — per user per day, or total bot per day?

### §8.6 · Commits 11–14 — Referral graph + Loyalty platform
- Q: **Legal compliance** — what is the local Nigerian regulation on multi-level commission structures? (Requires lawyer/accountant conversation BEFORE any code.)
- Q: **Identity reconciliation** — what does the existing `atfactoryprice.com` user table look like? Email, phone, username? How do we link to Telegram IDs?
- Q: **Commission formula** — how many levels deep do points flow? What % at each level? Fixed schedule (e.g. 10/5/2 for L1/L2/L3) or configurable per-product/per-event?
- Q: **Worker chain trigger events** — does Abdul earn when his sub-worker completes a task, brings an order, brings a customer, brings another worker? All of the above? Different point values per event?
- Q: **Customer chain trigger events** — does the referring customer earn on every purchase, only the first purchase, or a percentage of lifetime spend?
- Q: **Point expiry** — do points expire? After how long? Or never?
- Q: **Point transferability** — can a distributor transfer points to another distributor or customer? Or strictly non-transferable?
- Q: **Withdrawal-on-departure** — if a worker/distributor leaves, what happens to their accumulated points? Forfeit? Cash out? Time-windowed cash out?
- Q: **Accounting treatment** — points granted are a liability on the books; how do we recognize them? (Requires accountant conversation.)
- Q: **Redemption catalog** — what can points be redeemed for? Computer, software, hardware, discount on next purchase, cash equivalent? Configurable list?
- Q: **Cross-chain interactions** — can a worker also be a customer (earning in both chains)? Most likely yes; how does the bot prevent double-dipping (earning twice on the same transaction)?
- Q: **Referral code format** — auto-generated (`AFP-ABDUL-001`) or user-chosen with admin approval?

## §9 · Validation gates & deployment

For every commit:
1. `npm run smoke` passes (≥ current count, no regressions).
2. Manual smoke per `TESTING.md` section that touches the changed surface.
3. Deploy to Railway → wait ~2 min for cold start → /health 200 check.
4. End-to-end test with at least one real Telegram account (Abdul for doer, John for assigner).
5. Watch `WebhookErrors` for 24h after any high-risk change.

For phase boundaries (Commit 4 done, Commit 7 done, etc.):
- Backup the relevant sheets before the first user assignment runs in production.
- Document the rollback procedure in the commit message.

## §10 · Appendix — legacy detail (TG-1 .. TG-26)

The full per-task detail (file paths, acceptance criteria, risk/rollback) for TG-1 through TG-26 lived in the former `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`. Tasks that are ⏸ Deferred above retain that detail — when someone picks one up, they should re-derive the spec from the live codebase (paths/line numbers will have drifted) rather than relying on the stale write-up.

If a deferred task becomes top of mind, expand it in §5 with a fresh design before starting work.

---

*This document is the merge of `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` v1.0 and `ORG_HIERARCHY_DESIGN.md` v1.0. Both source files are removed. Edits to this document should keep the §1-§9 separation crisp.*
